"Devices supposed to stop blackouts helped cause the big one Saturday in Manhattan, Con Ed says","A system meant to prevent electric outages helped cause the big one that hit Manhattan over the weekend, Con Edison said.,It began when a 13,000-volt distribution cable failed at W. 64th St. and West End Ave. about 6:47 p.m. Saturday, the company said in a statement on Monday.,But the cable failure was just the beginning of the problem.,A series of relay switches about a block away, at the company’s W. 65th St. substation, should have automatically diverted power around the failed cable, the company says.,Those relays failed.,“While the cable fault was an initiating event, the customer outages were the result of the failure of the protective relay systems,” Con Ed explained in a statement.,The failure cascaded through the company’s cables and switching systems to a substation at W. 49th St. — where relays prevented the outage from spreading further.,But by then the damage was done — power was gone on a swath of Manhattan’s west side, rouighly from W. 72nd St. south to W. 30th St. The approximate eastern boundary of the blackout was Fifth Ave.,Con Ed initially believed the failure of the 13,000-volt cable at W. 64th St. was “unrelated to the transmission disturbance” — but further investigation proved that it was the blackout’s triggering event, the company said.,More than half the 72,000 Con Ed customers affected by the blackout had power back in about three hours, the company said. Everyone affected had power back by around midnight.,Mayor de Blasio — who was pursuing his long-shot presidential candidacy in Iowa when the blackout hit — challenged the judgment of the company’s engineers.,“I am troubled that one of the few factors Con Edison initially ruled out, the 13,000 volt cable, has been determined to be the catalyst of the outage,” de Blasio said.,“Thankfully, as a result of the quick work of our first responders, no one was injured and there was no spike in crime in the five hours the incident lasted.”"

She did the Ice Bucket Challenge — then found out she had ALS ,"Back in 2014, which is several centuries in Internet time, Sunny Brous Erasmus, was one of the many, many people to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, where people dumped water on their heads to raise money and awareness of ALS, an incurable nerve system disease.,Unbeknownst to her, though, she had actually begun experiencing symptoms of the disease the year prior.,“Everyone else was doing it, so why not?” ,. “It was a good cause and a fun activity to get involved with.”,After several months of dealing with bouts of weakness and exhaustion, Erasmus began a process of being diagnosed with ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, that lasted more than a year.,“ALS is a disease of suggestion. There’s no qualifier, so we had to rule out tons of different diseases before I was diagnosed,” she says. “I had more blood drawn than I knew I had in my body. I had an MRI to rule out multiple sclerosis. I had a spinal tap to rule out Lyme disease. It just takes forever to go around the horn and back to get any kind of understanding and general consensus.”,Erasmus knows that ALS moves quickly in most cases, but she’s keeping her spirits up.,“I’ve met people that were diagnosed and unfortunately were gone within six months,” Erasmus says. “I’ve met people that were diagnosed up to 20 years ago and they’re still kicking ass and taking names. For me, my symptoms when they started progressing, it will be five years since my diagnosis this coming January. I’m still walking. I obviously am still talking. I’m still driving. I walk really slow, and with a walking stick — his name is Phil. But I’m not in a wheelchair yet.”"

"Mayor de Blasio returns to NYC, defends his absence during Manhattan blackout","The lights were off, but Mayor de Blasio insisted he was never too far from home. ,Hizzoner was stompin’ the presidential campaign trail in Waterloo, Iowa, when part of his home base descended into darkness in a major blackout on Saturday, but he defended his absence because technology kept him connected to the city.,“With modern communications, the minute it was clear we had a serious situation, I was on the phone to all these folks and we were talking constantly,"" the mayor told reporters on Sunday after returning to New York more than 12 hours after electricity was restored. ,“I was going to have to provide guidance wherever I was.”,De Blasio was in the Midwestern town when he learned that the lights were out on the West Side in the city’s worst outage since Hurricane Sandy darkened much of lower Manhattan in 2012., which started just before 7 p.m. and lasted until midnight, trapped five trains carrying some 2,875 riders in subway tunnels, according to NYC Transit President Andy Byford. Other people were stuck in elevators. Broadway went dark, concerts abruptly ended and street lights went down.,Back in Iowa, De Blasio left Waterloo, population 67,000 ― about a third of the Upper West Side’s — at 9 p.m. Eastern time and was driven to Chicago on a four-hour trip to try to catch a late flight, he said. But he ended up spending the night at a hotel near O’Hare Airport, then stuck around Sunday morning for a live interview with CNN.,The quixotic candidate bemoaned Iowa’s lack of transportation, explaining to reporters on Sunday that it’s not easy to escape rural America on short notice.,“Unfortunately on a Saturday evening it’s a very long trip back so I wasn’t going to be able to be here immediately under any circumstance,"" said de Blasio. ""There’s fewer flights by the time we could get there, and we were in a place where it’s harder to get to a major airport from.”,The mayor has been out of the city most weekends since he announced his long-shot campaign for president in May.,The mayor’s absence gave Gov. Cuomo a chance to claim much of the credit for fixing the problem, which left hundreds of thousands of people in the dark from W. 72nd St. down to W. 30th St., and from Fifth Ave. to the Hudson River.,Cuomo sent in state police officers to keep the streets safe and called up the National Guard for assistance. He spent much of the night calling into numerous news shows to discuss the situation — and didn’t miss the opportunity to take a swipe at de Blasio.,""Mayors are important and you have to be on site, "" he said on CNN Saturday night. “I have been governor of New York for eight years. In that time I can count the number of times I’ve left the state on my fingers.”,Council Speaker Corey Johnson also took a share of the spotlight Saturday night, repeatedly calling into news networks and tweeting out updates to New Yorkers.,“I’m really happy I worked very closely with Speaker Johnson,” de Blasio said Sunday. “I think he did a great job yesterday.”"
Teen charged with shooting orphaned 3-year-old’s father indicted in connection to murder: DA,"The Harlem teen charged with gunning down the father of a now-orphaned 3-year-old girl was indicted in connection to the slaying, prosecutors said Monday.,The exact charges against D’Andre Ellis, 17, will remain sealed until he’s arraigned in Supreme Court on Aug. 14. He was arrested on murder and weapons possession charges last week after surrendering to authorities.,Prosecutors say he stalked 25-year-old Randy McNair and then shot him twice after 4 a.m. on June 15, on W. 133rd St.,“This case involves what can only be termed as premeditated murder,” Assistant District Attorney David Nasar said last week. ”For at least 20 minutes, the defendant and several other people are depicted on video basically hunting the victim.”,The Daily News reported that the tragedy left McNair’s little daughter Charlie to grow up without a mother or father — her mom Toni Wells was murdered in December 2017 in a domestic abuse incident in Brooklyn.,Charlie is now in the custody of her paternal grandmother, although there is fighting within the family over who should get to raise her. McNair had also been fighting for custody with Charlie’s maternal grandmother Elizabeth Rivera.,In court Monday, McNair’s mother Tamara Etheridge was worked up over the sight of her son’s alleged killer Ellis.,“I hope his ass rot in f------g jail,” she fumed before leaving the courtroom.,There was a brief discussion over whether his case would go before a youthful offender court judge because of his age but his attorney said a murder case would be sent back to adult court."
Hiker who vanished near California campgrounds with her dog is found alive,"A hiker who went missing last week was found , later by a search team, California authorities said Monday.,Sheryl Powell, described as an experienced hiker, went missing during a camping trip with her husband at the Grandview Campground in the Bristlecone Pine Forest.,After choosing a campsite, Sheryl Powell took the couple’s dog on a walk while her husband re-parked their Jeep. She was gone by the time he returned.,“Searchers describe her as resilient and strong but exhausted after being lost in an extremely remote area above Big Pine, Calif. Mrs. Powell was met at the Bishop Airport by ambulance and will be taken to the local hospital for medical clearance. ,""We are beyond grateful for the continued support from her family, local residents, visitors and the media. We also cannot thank our assisting agencies enough for their amazingly hard work in difficult terrain throughout this 4-day search,” ,.,Powell’s husband reached out to law enforcement after an hour of searching himself.,Shortly before the sheriff’s office said she was found, it announced Powell’s husband was not suspected in the disappearance.,The area presents challenges even for experienced hikers like Powell, the sheriff’s office said, such as “multiple gullies, shale slopes, low shade, direct sun and rattlesnakes.”"
Harvey Weinstein replaces lead attorney with woman lawyer critical of #MeToo movement ,"When it comes to #MeToo, count this woman out.,Attorney Donna Rotunno, now representing disgraced Oscar winner Harvey Weinstein against charges of rape and sexual assault, insisted Thursday that her new client was the real victim in the case.,“I believe he has been railroaded,” Rotunno declared after her debut at a Manhattan Supreme Court hearing. “I believe movements allow emotion to take over and they are devoid of fact and evidence, and I believe that to be the case ... The emotion of this case has taken over, and common sense has been left outside.”,Weinstein fired attorney Jose Baez as his lead lawyer for Rotunno, a Chicago-based counselor who specializes in defending men accused of sex crimes. Baez had represented acquitted killer Casey Anthony at her Florida acquittal for the murder of her 2-year-old daughter.,Rotunno insisted the movie industry pariah became the villain of the #MeToo awakening without any proof supporting the vile allegations leveled against Weinstein by dozens of women, including an assortment of Hollywood stars.,“I think it’s going to become quite obvious that the relationships he had with the women in this case were quite consensual and we have a lot of documentation to back this up,” she said. ""Mr. Weinstein has taken on 18 months or more of public scrutiny, and we are here to hope that the justice system allows him a fair trial.,""I believe that the facts and evidence in this case are actually very favorable to Mr. Weinstein.”,Rotunno said she was uniquely qualified by her gender to put Weinstein’s accusers under a full-court press on the witness stand.,“I think it’s a little more effective to have a woman asking a woman questions,” she said. “I think I can come across in a way that might not seem bullying or offensive.”,Asked about a past remark that she enjoys an advantage on cross-examinations of victims because she’s a woman, Rotunno didn’t back down.,“Absolutely,"" she said.,Rotunno was immediately ripped by Gloria Allred, a celebrity civil lawyer representing some of Weinstein’s accusers.,“I agree that women are responsible for their own choices, but when will Mr. Weinstein be held responsible for his?"" wondered Allred.,Rotunno, who has said she uses “venom” when trying sex assault cases, is already crossing lines, Allred suggested. She fully expects “we will see victim shaming and victim blaming” at trial.,“If this is Ms. Rotunna’s strategy, and if she believes that because she is a woman she can get away with it, she may find that New York juries will be turned off by that tactic,"" said the veteran attorney.,“A venomous attack on a victim who alleges that she has undergone traumatic sexual assault is not acceptable.”,Weinstein’s trial is still set to go forward on Sept. 9. Both sides agreed to swap witness lists at least two weeks in advance."

De Blasio’s presidential campaign raises a paltry $1.1M,"Mayor de Blasio’s presidential campaign against the rich is being funded by chump change, according to new campaign numbers.,The mayor’s quixotic bid for the White House raised nearly $1.1 million through the end of June, his campaign announced Monday. That’s far less than South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who raised a whopping $24.8 million between April and June, despite running a city with a population of only 102,000.,Presidential candidates had until Monday to file fundraising totals for this year’s second quarter with the Federal Election Commission.,De Blasio, who has called for tax hikes for wealthy Americans, finished last month with about $728,000 cash on hand, the campaign said. Of the $1.1 million raised from roughly 6,700 donors, 92% came from contributions of $50 or less.,While de Blasio didn’t raise the least of the more than 20 Democratic candidates for president, Hizzoner’s showing paled in comparison to heavy-hitters in the crowded field.,Former Vice President Joe Biden took in $21.5 million. Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $19.1 million and Sen. Bernie Sanders reported $18 million in donations.,Even New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand raised roughly twice what de Blasio took in – about $2.3 million.,Still, de Blasio 2020 celebrated the haul.,The campaign raised over $630,000 in the four days after “de Blasio’s impressive showing in the first Democratic primary debate,” according to a press release.,“We’re grateful to every supporter who chipped in because they share Mayor de Blasio’s message of putting working people first and we’re going to continue spreading that message to voters across the country,” campaign senior adviser John Paul Lupo said in a statement.,The fundraising boost allowed the mayor’s long-shot campaign to add staff and grow its New York headquarters, hiring three more city staffers.,Jess Moore Matthews, the city’s chief content officer since June 2018, will be the campaign’s digital director.,Jaclyn Rothenberg, a former spokeswoman and deputy communications director at City Hall, will become the campaign’s national press secretary. Rothenberg has already worked for the campaign in a volunteer capacity using vacation days.,And Will Baskin-Gerwitz will be a communications adviser for de Blasio 2020 after working as a spokesman in the mayor’s office for less than three months.,De Blasio’s 2020 campaign is already staffed with former city employees, including former deputy press secretary Olivia Lapeyrolerie and ex-deputy director of executive operations Alexandra Kopel. Lupo was also de Blasio’s intergovernmental affairs director before he began working for the campaign, initially in a volunteer capacity.,Three others, including the former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, were hired for the campaign’s outpost in the early-voting state. The campaign also hired a field director in Iowa.,Last week, the campaign even hired de Blasio’s son as a paid policy analyst. Dante de Blasio, a 21-year-old recent Yale grad, will help write a campaign platform and prepare his father for debates.,“These hires are a direct result of the fundraising success we’ve had in just a few short weeks, and our growth is a sign of what’s to come moving forward,” Lupo said.,De Blasio officially launched his bid for the White House on May 16 after toying with a campaign for half a year.,Before that, the mayor had been raising money through a federal political action committee he dubbed “Fairness PAC.” The committee polled potential Iowa caucus-goers and bankrolled his travel to early primary states.,Since then, de Blasio has struggled to gain momentum in the polls.,De Blasio had 1% in a , released the week after he announced. An , released just last week had de Blasio with less than 1%.,This hasn’t stopped de Blasio from campaigning every chance he gets in early voting states, where the mayor has spent most weekends since mid-May stumping to mostly sparse crowds. De Blasio and his wife, first lady Chirlane McCray, have traveled to Iowa, South Carolina, Las Vegas, New Hampshire, Miami, Chicago and Texas.,This weekend, the mayor was in Waterloo, Iowa, when a massive blackout plunged thousands into darkness in Manhattan. After dithering for hours, de Blasio decided to head home to address the crisis, only to finally return to the five boroughs 12 hours after electricity was restored.,“With modern communications, the minute it was clear we had a serious situation, I was on the phone to all these folks and we were talking constantly,"" the mayor told reporters on Sunday.,On Monday, de Blasio suggested that his handling of the blackout proved he’d be a good “chief executive” for the entire country.,“With some other folks, including folks who are running for president, you can look at their ideas, their words, their proposals – when you’re chief executive, you have to look at the whole picture, what did you get done?” de Blasio said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe."" “In six years, this is a very strong city today and with strong agencies that knew what to do in a crisis and did it in exemplary fashion.”"

"Fotis Dulos, estranged husband of missing New Canaan mother Jennifer Farber Dulos, attempted to get judge removed from his contentious divorce case","Days before Fotis Dulos prepared for another custody ruling from a judge he’d accused of being biased against him, he dropped a bombshell into the middle of his already bitter pending divorce from his estranged wife Jennifer Farber Dulos. He wanted the judge thrown off the case, claiming a phone call he had with her husband had created a conflict of interest.,Months earlier, as Dulos searched for an attorney to represent him in the divorce battle, he called Blank Rome, a high-end New York City law firm, on Jan. 16 and talked to Norman Heller about hiring him for representation. During the “consultation,” Dulos said they talked about the case pending in Stamford court. Norman Heller told Dulos he would need a retainer of $25,000 before he would agree to take the case.,In his March 13 motion to get Judge Donna Heller thrown off his divorce case, Dulos claimed he had no idea the attorney he was discussing fees with was the husband of the judge overseeing his contentious divorce. But he argued, “There’s a reasonable appearance of impropriety,” so Heller should be disqualified.,But Reuben Midler, Farber Dulos’ attorney, wasn’t buying Dulos’ claim that he didn’t know Norman Heller was the judge’s husband. In a sharply worded response to Dulos’ motion, Midler said it was “common knowledge” that the Hellers were married, and he asked the judge to order a psychological evaluation of Dulos, saying Dulos’ legal maneuver was further evidence of his “manipulative, coercive and scheming behaviors displayed throughout this case and which is indicative of an underlying and potentially untreatable mental condition or psychopathology that should be thoroughly investigated.”,Farber Dulos, 50, a mother of five, hasn’t been seen since dropping her children off at school in New Canaan on May 24. Dulos, a professional home builder from Farmington, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, have pleaded not guilty to evidence tampering and hindering prosecution, charges connected to her disappearance. Both are free after posting bail.,Police are examining the Dulos’ bitter divorce as part of their investigation and have launched a forensic audit of Dulos’ finances, racked in recent years by the enormous costs associated with the breakup, including fees paid to at least three attorneys who have worked on his case.,Midler in court papers said Dulos was preparing an “escape hatch” with his motion to get Judge Heller tossed from the case if her decision on visitation rights wasn’t to his liking and accused Dulos of trying to manipulate the judicial process. Midler said it was beyond comprehension that Dulos didn’t know what everyone in the courthouse knew — that Judge Heller’s husband was a New York attorney who handled family law.,Heller didn’t recuse herself from the Dulos’ divorce case. And a week after Dulos’ push to get her off the case, Heller issued new visitation orders drastically increasing Dulos’ time with his five children. While she insisted that his visits with the children be supervised, the judge ordered him to get the children every other weekend starting in late March.,Judge Heller declined to answer a series of questions The Courant submitted to her through the state judicial branch. Midler could not be reached for comment.,A transcript of the March 19 court hearing provides details of the conversation between Dulos and Norman Heller and the judge’s reasoning for not recusing herself from the case.,According to the transcript, Dulos testified that he called Blank Rome on the recommendation of another attorney looking for an expert in estate and trust law. He initially left a message with the firm. About a half hour later, Norman Heller called.,“When he introduced himself, that name just flew through my head. I didn’t — I — I didn’t make anything of it,” Dulos said, according to court transcripts.,Dulos said he told Norman Heller about his frustrations with his divorce case.,“That we’re just starting the discovery. That the case has gone backwards. That I was very disappointed with the pace of the case. I was disappointed by the — the — the behavior of Attorney Midler and his firm,” Dulos said. “That I thought they were basically taking advantage of my soon-to-be ex-wife and charging, charging, charging, and causing a lot of trouble for — for us as a family.”,Dulos said Heller told him his retainer fee was $25,000. The call lasted seven minutes, and Dulos didn’t retain him and never received a formal retainer letter from the firm, court transcripts said.,At no time did Dulos mention who the judge was in the case, and Heller never asked, Dulos testified, according to the transcripts.,Judge Heller said she was unaware of the short phone call to her husband until Dulos filed his complaint. She said it wasn’t enough for her to remove herself from the case.,“It was a seven-minute conversation. There was no retainer letter issued, no engagement letter. Mr. Dulos was not billed for the time,” Heller said, according to court transcripts. “No attorney-client relationship appears to have been formed based on the testimony of Mr. Dulos and the documents that have been — the exhibit that has been admitted.”,“I accept your testimony as to the subject matters that you discussed with Attorney Heller, but I have not asked him about that, and I have no intention of doing that,” Heller said, according to court transcripts. “So I don’t think there has been any prejudice to you. And I’m not going to disqualify myself because I don’t think that it affects my impartiality and fairness in this case at all.”,But Dulos didn’t stop his attack on the judge. He also submitted a critical letter about Judge Heller’s performance to the Judicial Selection Commission, which is charged with reappointing judges.,Dulos told the judge he had submitted the letter, telling Heller that he wrote that she was biased against him because he was Greek and insinuated that she had some arrangement with Midler’s law firm.,""That you have been biased in the case. That the case was progressing very well under Judge Colin,” Dulos said. “That I’ve seen my children for very little time. That I’ve been railroaded. That we even got to the point where my right to speak to my children in our native language has been taken away, and you have done nothing about it.”,“And you have passed such judgment on me, such harsh judgment on me, that I feel that it’s biased,"" court transcripts said.,Dulos said the children had stopped water skiing — a sport he taught them and in which two of them are nationally ranked. He said they stopped recognizing Greek traditions and learning the Greek language, the transcripts said.,“They stopped having contact with me for a — for over a year, Your Honor. Five kids. Who is going to give me that back?” Dulos said. “I feel you’ve been — you haven’t been very good to me, to my children, and to the case. And I have lost faith in your judgment. I’m sorry I’m going to say that, but that’s the truth. I’m — I’m speaking the truth,"" transcripts said.,Heller told Dulos that she should have been informed he had filed the letter, but that the statutes allowed her to continue with the case. She also said his letter apparently didn’t matter.,“And — so I’ve been approved for reappointment. I’ll put it that way. So whatever complaint Mr. Dulos made, the Judicial Section Commission has approved me for reappointment. But I did not have any knowledge of it, and I think I should have been informed,” Heller said, according to court transcripts.,A day after the hearing, Heller issued her new custody orders, which increased the amount of time that Dulos would see his children. One of the weekends that he was supposed to get the children was Memorial Day weekend.,But Farber Dulos went missing on May 24. And within days, Dulos was arrested after police said a man resembling him was seen on surveillance video throwing contractor bags filled with bloody towels and garments into trash cans on Albany Avenue in Hartford the same night Farber Dulos disappeared. Prosecutors have said the blood inside the bags was Farber Dulos’.,Dulos’ attorneys, Norm Pattis and Rich Rochlin, have filed a motion asking Heller to halt the divorce proceedings until Farber Dulos attends the hearings."

Bronx teen guilty in classroom stabbing of student,"A high school student who stabbed a classmate to death in a Bronx classroom couldn’t convince a judge he acted out of fear fueled by a lifetime of being bullied.,Abel Cedeno, who was tried in front of a judge rather than a jury and testified on his own behalf, was found guilty of all charges against him Monday. The 19-year-old began to cry after Bronx Supreme Court Judge Michael Gross read the verdict. ,As he was led from the courtroom, his mother and grandmother wept too, with his mother Luc Hernandez turning to him and saying: “I love you, papi.”,“I love you, too,” he responded, a tear running down his cheek.,Gross, who ultimately found Cedeno guilty of first degree manslaughter, assault and criminal weapons possession, wasn’t swayed by his testimony that he felt endangered by the two classmates he attacked with a knife in his history class at the now-closed Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation in the Bronx.,He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison for the most serious manslaughter charge. Gross ordered Cedeno be held without bail prior to sentencing, which is scheduled for Sept. 10.,“The presumption of innocence no longer applies to Mr. Cedeno,” Gross said. “This was a possible and foreseeable outcome.”,The verdict comes four days after Cedeno took the stand and offered a chilling retelling of how a classroom encounter on Sept. 27, 2017 with Matthew McCree and Ariane LaBoy left the 15-year-old McCree dead and put LaBoy, 16, in a coma for two days.,A classmate who testified last week, Jomarlyn Colon, said Cedeno had been looking for a fight after someone pelted him with a paper ball during class.,Cedeno testified that after a verbal altercation, McCree came toward him.,“I remember my arms going up, some of (the motions) might have been blocking, some might have been punching. I don’t specifically remember,” Cedeno said. “I don’t know the specific moment the blade entered their bodies.”,Cedeno had requested a non-jury trial at the outset of the legal proceedings.,On Thursday, he testified that he endured years of non-stop bullying over his sexuality at the school.,“They called me a b----h. They called me a f----t and gay,” he said of the taunts he endured in the years prior to the attack.,Cedeno’s lawyers argued their client was justified in killing McCree because he feared for this life.,McRee’s mother Louna Dennis stood outside the courthouse Monday and said the guilty verdict was the answer to her prayers. ,""What was in my heart? That praise be to God for this outcome — for the prayers and everything that all my family and church has been doing for me,” Dennis said. ""The glory goes to God first and foremost.”,Defense attorney Robert Feldman asked that Cedeno be placed in an LGBT dorm at Rikers Island until his sentencing, and Judge Gross said he would make that recommendation.,Gross also granted a request that Cedeno be placed in protective custody and receive psychiatric attention."
Air Force not planning to show 'them aliens’ to viral Area 51 raiders,"In the days since it was ,, the event “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us"" has racked up over a million joke (and probably a few not-really) RSVPs.,“We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,” the evite reads. “If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.”,The ,, but the organizers have clarified that it’s a joke, most likely in hopes that the government doesn’t use secret alien technology from the conspiracy-laden Air Force base against them.,A pinned tweet on the page reads, “Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.”,The Air Force isn’t taking any chances, issuing a stern (but enticingly vague) warning that people should stay away from the base.,“[Area 51] is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces,” ,. “The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.”,Head over to the event’s Facebook page to check out the memes other users have created and speculate about that Air Force spokesperson means by “assets.”"
"Oddsmakers banking on ‘Veep,’ ‘Mrs. Maisel,’ ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Killing Eve’ to dominate Emmy nominations","Tuesday’s announcement for the nominees of the 71st Emmy Awards should be the most compelling yet. Despite critical ambivalence to the final season of “Game of Thrones,” will the venerable three-time Best Drama series even get the opportunity to defend its title?,Will 2018′s winner “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” hold off three-time Best Comedy champ “Veep,” which has finished its series run? ""Is audience favorite “Killing Eve” still a dark horse contender, or were Emmy voters put off by a perceived Season 2 slump?,The Gold Derby Awards’ latest odds reveal plenty of surprises. Utilizing a system of active TV participants, the website has assessed the odds for most Emmy contenders. Let’s break down their chances and pick out some overvalued or undervalued contenders.,One of the most tightly contested races is for ,. Last year’s title holder Claire Foy is out of the running as her reign as Queen Elizabeth on “The Crown"" has come to an end. That leaves a top-heavy race that includes front-runners Laura Linney (”Ozark""), Julia Roberts (“Homecoming”), Emilia Clarke (“Game of Thrones”), Robin Wright (“House of Cards”) and “Killing Eve” stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer.,In its latest odds, Gold Derby has installed Oh as front-runner at 71/20 — meaning a successful $20 bet would net a $71 profit. While Oh was the show’s breakout star in Season 1, Comer seems the more likely bet this go-round as the quirky, Russian psychopath killer Villanelle. In a majority of the eight Season 2 episodes, Oh took a backseat to the action as Villanelle’s backstory — not to mention her unrequited feelings for Eve — were pivotal plot points.,Wright, a five-time Emmy nominee in this category was brilliant yet again as steely President Claire Underwood, but “House of Cards” aired its last season way back in November 2018. Linney (5/1), a former Emmy winner for “The Big C,” and Roberts (11/2) in an understated role are shoo-ins. Viola Davis, the 2015 recipient of this award, might benefit from the nostalgia vote as “How to Get Away with Murder” is currently filming its sixth and final season.,Will Clarke, as power-hungry Daenerys be rewarded for her “Thrones” performance? What about Christine Baranski from “The Good Fight,” who’s currently fielding 11/1 odds to win? They likely sneak into the race but the road to victory will be much more arduous.,Expect to see a healthy mix of new and familiar faces in the race for ,. Oddsmakers have installed Bob Odenkirk of “Better Call Saul” as the front-runner at 4/1 but the better money should be on Jason Bateman from “Ozark” at 9/2 to win.,While both will assuredly hear their names mentioned Tuesday, it gets a little trickier after that. Kit Harington aka Jon Snow of “Game of Thrones” has received one previous Emmy nomination but that had been in the supporting category. Clearly, he was the most important character during this final season but will voters hold the show’s tepid praise against him? It’s a possibility, which makes his 10/1 victory odds to win a bit steep.,Sterling K. Brown, who won the award two years ago, should be back in contention for “This Is Us” despite viewership being down about 20% this past season. His 6/1 odds seem a bit low and he could be the man to beat come September.,That leaves new kids on the block, Richard Madden (“Bodyguard"") and Billy Porter (“Pose”), stars of series with small but rabid followings. Madden surprisingly snagged a Golden Globe for “Bodyguard” back in January, while the second-season premiere for “Pose” debuted less than six weeks ago. At 5/1, Madden’s odds seem overly favorable as does Porter at 15/2. Could there be a surprise who sneaks into contention? Perhaps “Succession’s” Brian Cox (25/1 to win) or 2019 Screen Actors Guild nominee John Krasinski for “Jack Ryan?"",The , competition looks like a three-horse race between “Game of Thrones,” “Killing Eve” and “Ozark.” All will officially be in the running on Tuesday as could be “Pose,” “Homecoming” and “Bodyguard.”,But with a field likely to field seven contenders, could HBO’s “Gentleman Jack” pull off the upset — a 100/1 long shot to win — or maybe “Doctor Who?”,Don’t sleep on Netflix’s beautifully bizarre supernatural series “The OA.” The nearly three-year wait for Season 2 was a small prize to pay for a gloriously trippy adventure that provided more questions than answers. The show could fill the gap that “Stranger Things” would likely have occupied had it been eligible.,While the Drama categories races should be chock-full of intrigue, the main Comedy divisions will likely offer less intrigue. As many as seven men could vie for ,with Bill Hader (“Barry”), Michael Douglas (“The Kominsky Method”), Ted Danson (“The Good Place”), Anthony Anderson (“Black-ish”) and Jim Carrey (“Kidding”) expected to secure nods. Don Cheadle is getting 15/2 to win for “Black Monday” but a nomination is no guarantee. Ditto, four-time winner Jim Parsons for “The Big Bang Theory,” which recently completed its 12-season run.,Carrey, at 13/1 to win, was surprisingly overlooked in 2018 as William H. Macy for “Shameless” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm’s” Larry David made the cut. While “Kidding” has met with generally positive reviews, Carrey’s performance has been universally lauded. There’s good value here for him to be toting Emmy home on Sept. 22.,Last year’s winner, Hader, leads all comers at 7/2, but Douglas is right behind him at 4/1. Danson could be the sentimental favorite at 5/1. The 71-year-old star snagged two Emmy Awards during his “Cheers” stint but none since 1993.,And what about Sacha Baron Cohen for “Who is America?” Duping the likes of Roy Moore and Dick Cheney may have been riotous but perhaps a bridge too far for some right-leaning Emmy voters? His odds of taking home the award have dipped to 100/1.,If you want to guess who is most likely to win the ,, flip a coin. You will have to wait two months for the race between “Veep’s” Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Rachel Brosnahan of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” to play out. The rest of the would-be field is merely fodder. Allison Janney from “Mom” remains a healthy odds nominee at 7/1 as does Natasha Lyonne from “Russian Doll” and Phoebe Waller-Bridge of “Fleabag” fame — both installed at 15/2.,Has the luster finally faded from “Grace & Frankie” gals Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin? Both legends continue to perform at an elite comedic level, but too many voters view the show as being too lightweight. That likely dooms any chance at nominations, let alone a win. Pamela Adlon, the star of “Better Things,” seems to be a polarizing figure among voters — some of which are put off by her character’s brusqueness. She’s at 19/2 to win.,And could Christina Applegate, a two-time nominee in this category last decade for “Samantha Who?” horn her way in for “Dead to Me?” She’s a 54/1 long shot to win.,Finally, the race for the , could be a mishmash of old and new, cable and streaming. “The Good Place” is the only realistic network TV contender. Odds are at 9/1 to win and will likely grab a nomination. “Veep"" at 5/1, “Mrs. Maisel” at 11/2, “Barry” (6/1) and “the Kominsky Method” at 15/2 all appear to be locks, as does the critical darling “Fleabag,” which has gotten a major boost since one of its stars, Olivia Colman, won the Oscar for “The Queen” in February.,And can the Little Engine That Could better known as “Schitt’s Creek"" — which gets funnier with each passing season — finally crash the Emmy party? Oddsmakers are dubious, placing it at 92/1 to win in September."
Tekashi69’s former manager pleads guilty in restaurant shooting case,"Brooklyn rapper Tekashi 69’s former manager took a time-served plea deal on Monday to settle criminal charges for his role in a Midtown restaurant brawl in which a shot was fired.,Kifano Jordan, 36, was in Manhattan Supreme Court to face assault and weapons counts stemming from the Oct. 26 shooting inside Philippe’s on E. 60th St. between Madison and Park Aves., where a brawl broke out among members of Tekashi’s entourage and a shot was fired by one of the performer’s security guards, a retired cop. ,Jordan, aka Shotti, was accused of being the main instigator. ,“(Jordan) struck a private security guard in the head with a chair after being refused entry into a restaurant where a business meeting was to occur,” prosecutor Gilbert Rein said at his arraignment.

"SEE IT: Woman in Brazil shoves well-known priest off stage in front of 50,000 people","A woman ran onstage and violently shoved a famous priest during a Mass Sunday in Cachoeira Paulista, a city located 130 miles southwest of São Paulo, Brazil.,In the shocking video, an unnamed 32-year-old woman is seen running toward Padre Marcelo Rossi, a wildly popular preacher in the country, and then shoving him off the stage.,The shocked audience of 50,000 can be seen screaming in incredulity.,The incident happened shortly before 3 p.m. on Sunday during the closing Mass of a traditional youth retreat. Around 50,000 young Catholics were in attendance, the Brazilian news site,According to the police, the woman was one of the participants in the retreat. She was accompanied by a group who had traveled from Rio de Janeiro to attend. They reportedly told the police that she suffers from mental health problems.,The newspaper O Dia reported that the woman, who was at the event with her 3-year-old son, told reporters Monday that what happened was “between [Rossi] and I.”,The priest, who decided not to press charges, wasn’t seriously hurt.,The church released a video after the incident saying that he felt some pain, but hadn’t broken anything: “The priest is well. He was attended by the medical staff at the event and presided over the celebration to the end.”,Dubbed Brazil’s , by the Associated Press, and Brazil’s , by Newsweek, Rossi has been a phenomenon in popular culture in Brazil since the late 1990s.,A former physical education teacher, he was ordained as a priest in 1994. His charismatic approach to minister Catholics in Brazil struck a chord with the religious population in the country, and he eventually became a mainstream celebrity.,He’s a best-selling author and singer, whose events routinely sell out stadiums.,Rossi is also a vocal anti-gay crusader, who in 1998 , that “a lot of ideas will change the day homosexuality is proven to be an illness,"" and in 2012 , that same-sex marriage “doesn’t come from God.”"
"Former Met Travis d’Arnaud punishes Yankees pitchers with three home runs, including the game winner","The Yankees may be more upset at the Mets for releasing Travis d’Arnaud than Mets fans these days. The former Mets catcher, who has had a resurgence with the Rays, delivered the game-winning dagger against the Bombers for the second time in three games. ,Monday night, d’Arnaud hammered three home runs, his third the game-winner with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, off Yankees’ All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman. D’Arnaud’s third, a three-run shot to right field, rallied the Rays for a big 5-4 win over the Bombers at Yankee Stadium. ,“I’m really excited,” d’Arnaud said. “We’ve beat them in three in a row now and before that, they were beating us quite a few times in a row. So it’s nice to win game one here and have the momentum going into tomorrow.”,D’Arnaud, who finished 3-for-3 with five RBI, battled Chapman in an eight-pitch at-bat, taking two strikes against him, before hitting his third homer of the night, and fourth against the Yankees in 11 games.,“All night, the slider had been working for me. I was trying to surprise him with the slider, down and away,” Chapman said. “That one was a little higher than I wanted, and he took advantage of it.”,D’Arnaud’s fly ball flew beyond the long reach of Yankees’ 6-foot-8 right fielder Aaron Judge and into the right-field stands. ,The Rays (56-40) cut into the lead the Yankees (59-33) hold in the American League East, in the rivals’ last series until the final week of the regular season in September. The Rays have won three straight against the Yankees, whose lead in the division was cut to five games. ,D’Arnaud’s walk off homer against the Yankees on July 6 at Tropicana Field was the start of the Rays’ three-game winning streak over the Yankees. ,It was fourth blown save for Chapman this season and the second loss he has taken. It was just the 10th home run that Chapman has allowed with runners on base and the fourth three-run homer he’s allowed in his career.,“Thought he threw the ball alright. I mean, a great at-bat by d’Arnaud there to finish it off,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""(Kevin) Kiermaier battled on the squibbed one to get things started, and then (Guillermo) Heredia jumped on a ball, I thought he threw the ball fine. d’Arnaud did a good job of laying off tough pitches when Chappy was ahead in the count and finally got a mistake and finished off what was a pretty great night obviously.”,The Mets, who tendered d’Arnaud a $3.52 million contract in December after he missed most of the 2018 season because of Tommy John surgery, released the catcher after just 25 at-bats and are now responsible for the remaining $2.9 million on his contract. He was signed by the Dodgers and then traded to the Rays, where he has emerged as a thorn in the Yankees’ side. ,Monday night, he jumped on James Paxton early, hitting his first career lead-off home run. He then got Paxton again in the third with another solo homer. ,“D’Arnaud was really hot, swinging the bat really well. I left some balls in the middle, but even his other at-bats he was taking some really good pitches, especially that last at-bat against Chappy,” Paxton said. “He was taking some sliders in the dirt, just really good takes and then good swings on the ball.”,Those were the only runs Paxton gave up Monday in six innings work. He struck out seven and scattered five other hits. ,D’Arnaud became the first catcher to ever hit three home runs against the Yankees in one game, and the first catcher in Rays history to hit three homers in a game. ,The 30-year-old bested a two-home run night by Edwin Encarnacion and spoiled the narrative of Gio Urshela’s second-half resurgence, with a game-tying home run on Monday night. ,“All of his at-bats were really good. I mean, kind of what we’ve seen from him, he hurt us obviously down in Tampa as well,” Boone said. “I just thought he had obviously really good at-bats, you know, got a couple fastballs that looked like in the heart of the plate that he took advantage of against Paxton. His next at-bat, I think it was against (Chad Green) where, I think he had a walk. All night long, laying off tough pitches, spoiling pitches. Really good at-bats, and obviously he was the difference.”"
"A missile, guns and Nazi paraphernalia were confiscated by Italian police after arrest ","Italian police confiscated an arsenal including an air-to-air missile during an arrest of three men, one of whom was a former neo-fascist political candidate.,Cops in Turin found dozens of hunting rifles, assault weapons and pistols in the home of former Forza Nuova party candidate Fabio Del Bergiolo, according to ,. Nazi paraphernalia was also collected from the 50-year-old right-winger’s home, the report said. Del Bergiolo once worked as a customs agent., Torino ha concluso un’operazione nei confronti di 3 persone responsabili di detenzione di armi da guerra e da sparo.,Dalle indagini si è scoperta anche una trattativa per la compravendita di un missile aria – aria sequestrato in provincia di Pavia ,Police also picked up Alessandro Monti, 42, and Fabio Bernardi, 51, in connection with the French-made missile they discovered in an airport hangar. They believe the men were hoping to sell the weapon. Authorities posted a photo of their menacing haul on Twitter along with the claim they’d “revealed a negotiation” involving the deadly projectile.,The investigation leading to the three arrests was reportedly connected to a crackdown of far-right extremists with ties to Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine."
Here are the Republican lawmakers who have condemned Trump’s racist ‘go back’ tweets ,"A number of congressional Republicans broke ranks Monday and condemned President Trump over a series of racist tweets he had posted a day earlier.,While the two top Republicans in Congress — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — stayed mum, at least 18 of their GOP colleagues felt the need to speak out after Trump told four Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested” countries “from which they came.”,Only one of the congresswomen, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, is foreign-born. All four are U.S. citizens and women of color.,The Long Island Republican called Trump’s tweets “inappropriate and wrong.”,“I don’t think he’s a racist, but I think the comments can be interpreted in a very negative way. They could inflame racist tendencies that people may have,” King told the Daily News. “You have to be careful with what you say.”,While I strongly disagree with the tactics, policies, and rhetoric of the far-left socialist ‘Squad,’ the President’s tweets were inappropriate, denigrating, and wrong. It is unacceptable to to tell legal U.S. citizens to go back to their home country,” Stefanik tweeted.,“The President’s tweets were wrong. I have vehemently criticized lawmakers on the far-left when I disagree with the direction in which they want to take the country — but criticism should focus on policy,” Katko tweeted.,“America is the only country in the world which gives anyone the opportunity to fulfill their dreams, and I will never apologize for America. There is no doubt extremists in the far left of the Democrat party spout hate for Israel and want to turn America into socialist Venezuela. Though I disagree with the form of the President’s message, defending America is something I will always be proud to do,"" Reed said in a statement.,I am confident that every Member of Congress is a committed American. ,’s tweets from this weekend were racist and he should apologize. We must work as a country to rise above hate, not enable it,” Turner tweeted.,The Tweet President Trump posted over the weekend about fellow Members of Congress are not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas 22. We are proud to be the most diverse Congressional district in America. I urge our President immediately disavow his comments,” Olson tweeted.,Hurd told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that Trump’s tweets were “racist and xenophobic.”,“They’re also inaccurate. The four women he’s referring to are actually citizens of the United States,” Hurd added.,POTUS was wrong to say any American citizen, whether in Congress or not, has any ‘home’ besides the U.S. But I just as strongly believe non-citizens who abuse our immigration laws should be sent home immediately, & Reps who refuse to defend America should be sent home 11/2020,” Roy tweeted.,We must be better than comments like these,” Mitchell tweeted at Trump. “I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.”,Frankly I’m appalled by the President’s tweets. There’s no excuse. Inflammatory rhetoric from both sides of the aisle that is used to divide us just isn’t right. It’s not helpful. We have too many challenges facing us that we ought to be working on together — immigration, the debt ceiling, the border crisis,” Upton tweeted. “The President’s tweets were flat out wrong and uncalled for, and I would encourage my colleagues from both parties to stop talking so much and start governing more.”,“As Americans, there is more that unites us than divides us,” Brooks said in a statement. “The President’s remarks to my colleagues across the aisle are inappropriate and do not reflect American values. ALL of our elected officials need to raise their level of civility in order to address the serious issues facing our country.”,“I am deeply disappointed in the president’s comments directed toward fellow Americans and members of Congress. Use of such language is inappropriate and demeans the office of the presidency,” Cole tweeted.,“The president’s comments were destructive, demeaning, and disunifying. The President of the United States has a unique and noble calling to unite the American people — of all different races, colors, and national origins. In that respect, the president failed badly,” Romney tweeted. “People can disagree over politics and policy, but telling American citizens to go back to where they came from is over the line.”,There is no excuse for the president’s spiteful comments — they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop,” Murkowksi tweeted. “We have enough challenges addressing the humanitarian crises both at our borders and around the world. Instead of digging deeper into the mud with personal, vindictive insults –we must demand a higher standard of decorum and decency.”,“The President interjected with unacceptable personal attacks and racially offensive language,” tweeted Scott, the only African-American Republican in the Senate. “No matter our political disagreements, aiming for the lowest common denominator will only divide our nation further.”,“Just because the so-called squad constantly insults and attacks the president isn’t a reason to adopt their unacceptable tactics,” Blunt said in a statement. “There is plenty to say about how destructive House Democrats’ policies would be for our economy, our health care system, and our security. I think that’s where the focus should be.”,“President Trump was wrong to suggest that four left-wing congresswomen should go back to where they came from,"" Toomey said in a statement. ""Three of the four were born in America and the citizenship of all four is as valid as mine...We should defeat their ideas on the merits.”,“I disagree strongly with many of the views and comments of some of the far-left members of the House Democratic Caucus — especially when it comes to their views on socialism, their anti-Semitic rhetoric, and their negative comments about law enforcement — but the President’s tweet that some Members of Congress should go back to the ‘places from which they came’ was way over the line, and he should take that down,” Collins said in a statement."
"Racist president, cowardly party: The GOP must speak up against Trump’s terrible words","There are red states, blue states and, it is now clear, yellow states. The yellow states are represented in Congress by Republicans too cowardly to condemn a president who resorts to unabashed racism not only to stir his base, but also to express his genuine bigotry. Donald Trump does not drink. Stark sober, he is drunk on hate.,In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s tweet about four Democratic congresswomen — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts — the GOP went mute. Here and there came objections, but no full-throated, unified denunciation of the president’s bigotry.,Trump told the women in question to “go back” to the countries they had come from. To do so, three of them need only to stay in place. Just one of them, Omar, was born elsewhere — Somalia. All four, though, are women of color. That, of course, was Trump’s point.,Republicans must acknowledge: The party has been taken over by a racist. The Trump of last weekend’s tweet binge was the culmination of a racist electoral strategy going back to Richard Nixon’s southern strategy and Ronald Reagan’s aw-shucks indifference to civil rights. Early in the 1980 campaign, Reagan went to Mississippi’s Neshoba County fair to, among other things, extol “states’ rights.” He tastelessly uttered those loaded words near where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. The Reagan smile could not mask the appeal to bigotry.,As for Trump, it should come as no surprise that he is a racist. Those who think he is merely appealing to his base and that, in private, he retires to read the speeches of Frederick Douglass ought to chat up people who have long known him. Former associates say his language is often clotted with racist references.,Even before he officially ran for president, he was promoting his racist “birther” theory, insisting that Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii but in some foreign country — probably Kenya, his father’s homeland. Despite it being an obvious lie, Trump stuck to his guns. It was as if he could not fathom how a black person could be an American president. He even said he had dispatched private investigators to Hawaii to get the truth.,I can empathize with some Republicans. Take Lindsey Graham. With considerable understatement he once called Trump a “race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.” But that was then. That was before Trump proved hugely popular in Graham’s South Carolina, particularly among Republicans. Graham, who’s up for reelection in 2020, must figure that if he denounced Trump, he will lose the Republican senatorial primary. And if that happens, he will not be replaced by a relative moderate but by a rabid Trumper. ,, as the lawyers like to say. Who benefits? No one. Better to swallow indignation and play the occasional round of golf with the president. Graham’s handicap must be a troubled conscience. ,But the consequences of silence are dear. America’s oldest scar — race — is being ripped open. We are a magical, marvelous nation, but we are not immune to the forces of racial chauvinism that have divided other nations. This is not what we want for America. We expel none of our citizens. We send none of them back.,The silence on the right has helped produce a reaction on the left. In the 1930s, the rise of fascism triggered a concurrent rise in communism — a fighting fire with fire sort of thing. Now we have liberals advocating and endorsing a pernicious brand of identity politics where everyone has a label, and certain labels grant unquestioned and unquestionable virtue. This stifles needed debate and produces its own reaction. It is fodder for Trump.,It was said of Mussolini that he made the trains run on time. Now Republicans and others parrot a version of that amoral argument. They deplore Trump’s rhetoric, but say he has kept unemployment low, employment high and sent the stock market into the ozone layer. But there is a cost to all this. Trump may fatten some wallets, but he feasts on the country’s soul. With an insolence borne of ignorance, he gives history the finger and traffics in the blood of Civil War dead, civil rights martyrs and the “Strange Fruit” of countless lynchings. The GOP’s silence in the face of all this is not just shameful, it is wrenching.,For crying out loud, say something!"
"Ben Simmons inks 5-year, $170 million max contract extension with the Sixers","PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia 76ers and star guard Ben Simmons have agreed to a $170 million, five-year contract extension, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The max deal is the latest big commitment by a team expected to make a serious push at its first NBA championship since 1983.,Simmons, 22, will make about $8.1 million this season, the last of his four-year rookie deal. His salary for the next season will jump to about $29.3 million and rise to nearly $39 million in 2024-25, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the contract is not official.,The deal solidifies the 76ers' core for the next few seasons. All-Star Joel Embiid and Al Horford are under contract though 2023, Tobias Harris through 2024 and now Simmons through 2025. Horford got a $109 million, four-year deal and Embiid agreed last season to a $147 million, five-year deal.,Sixers general manager Elton Brand had until the middle of October to reach a max deal with Simmons but wasted little time in locking up another cornerstone player.,Simmons was the No. 1 overall draft pick in the 2016. He made his NBA debut in the 2017-18 season and was Rookie of the Year. He was an All-Star for the first time last season. He has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists in his two seasons.,""I think I want to work on everything and continue to let my game grow,"" Simmons said at the end of the season. ""I think the one thing I got a lot better at this season was leadership."",The Sixers were knocked out of the Eastern Conference semifinals for the second straight season.,Philadelphia is 101-58 in regular-season games when Simmons plays. He has had 22 triple-doubles in the last two seasons, tied for third most in the league with Denver's Nikola Jokic and trailing Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook (59) and the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James (26).,Simmons also has had 80 double-doubles over the last two seasons.,But he missed all 11 3-point attempts his rookie season and was 0 for 6 last season, a combination of an awkward shooting form and a hesitancy to keep shooting shots he can't make. Defenses sagged on Simmons daring him to shoot because the speedy All-Star can't do much outside the paint.,""I don't think it's taking shots just to take them,"" Simmons said. ""I think it's just being aggressive and doing my job. I don't think it's any certain shot.
